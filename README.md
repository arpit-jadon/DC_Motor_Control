# Direction-and-Revolution-Control-of-DC-Motor-Using-Arduino-L298N-Motor-Driver-and-IR-Sensor.
Direction of the motor can be controlled by the character input in serial monitor input send box and the revolutions 
can be controlled by changing the Turns variable within the code. 
IR Sensor helps as in providing the feedback to the arduino in order to keep a check on the number of revolutions moved.
L298N motor driver is needed to switch the direction of the DC motor.
